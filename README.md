# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

This application retrieves daily weather forecast data from an API, processes it, and provides recommendations for suitable clothing to the user based on the forecast. The weather forecast data is obtained through an API call, and then analyzed to determine the type of weather conditions expected for the day. Based on the weather conditions, the application provides recommendations for clothing that would be suitable for the user to wear. The goal of the application is to help users prepare for the weather and dress appropriately for their daily activities.
